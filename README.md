Term 3 project -  E-commerce store -- 
WatchIt is an online watch selling platform where users can buy watches. The project allows for an admin to sign in and manage the inventory and orders and for users to order watches.
Users must be signed in to create an order and the site uses JWT to secure the signing up and logging in proces. Admins are able to add, update and delete products.
The store is built with the MERN stack using React for the front end, MongoDB as the noSQL database and Node.JS for the back end.
Thanks to React and React Bootstrap, WatchIt is fully responsive and built with various screen sizes in mind. It is made to look good on any device!
